# weba11y-WCAG-working-examples
All of my explanations and working examples on the WCAG Success Criteria. Some examples are referenced from other sources (cited within) while others are my own examples of common issues I see when testing for accessibility.

##  Examples (in `src/` folder)

- **[Focus Visible (SC 2.4.7)](src/focus-visibleSC2.4.7.html)**  

- **[Labels or Instructions (SC 3.3.2)](src/labels-instructionsSC3.3.2.html)**
